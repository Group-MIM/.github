Yes, we are building the future of the industry with GitHub. In fact, we’ve been doing this since October 22th June, 2023. That's when we made our first commit.

💗 The heart of Group MIM is technology and community and is fundamental to how we build software today. 

We do smart projects around the world 🌍 

In the last year alone Every minute a developer creates a new release 🏄
