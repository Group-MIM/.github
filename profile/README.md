## Hi there 👋


we are building the future with GitHub. In fact, we’ve been doing this since October 22th June, 2023. That's when we made our first commit.

💗 Our heart is technology and community and is fundamental to how we build software today.

🌍 We build smart factories around the world. 

☝️ Are we contributing to open source? Yes? Okay, we rock! 🎸 

🔧 We are also maintaining.

Oh, and by the way, we are always hiring talented, passionate people to join our team 🙌.
