Yes, we are building future on GitHub. In fact, we’ve been doing this since October 19th, 2023. That's when we made our first commit. 

🍿 An interconnected community
The open source community is the 💗 heart of GitHub and fundamental to how we build software today. See for yourself:

GitHub Sponsors helped support more than 5k individuals and projects around the world 🌍
Open source projects on GitHub received a stunning 218 million contributions 🚀 in the last year alone
Every minute a developer creates a new release 🏄 for a public project on GitHub
Now that we are talking about the important things ☝️, are you contributing to open source? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Open source software is made by people just like you. Learn more about how to contribute.

🦦 Contributing to the ecosystem
We contribute to the tools 🔧 we rely on to build and run GitHub, while also maintaining 🧙‍♂️ our own open source projects.
